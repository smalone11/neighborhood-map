# Neighborhood Map Project

## Running the Application

1. Open index.html in browser to run the application.

## Features

1. The left list contains the names of each of the markers on the map to the right.

2. Clicking on a name in the list will cause the corresponding marker to open a window with information about the location.
  1. The Foursquare icon at the end of each information window will take you to the full Foursquare page for that location.

3. Clicking on any of the markers will also bring up the window.

4. The search bar in the top left of the site allows you to narrow down the locations based on what is typed in. Uppercase and lowercase letters do not matter.
  1. To see all the markers again, you can clear the text in the search bar or refresh the page.
